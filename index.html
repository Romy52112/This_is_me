            <p>This is our second project in bootcamp. We still need to improve some of it's feature. This app is Addressing rising health concerns. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and lifestyle-related health issues was a primary motivator. Many individuals struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle due to a lack of knowledge and tools.Our goal was to create an app that empowers people to take control of their health by providing easy access to vital health information and personalized advice.
